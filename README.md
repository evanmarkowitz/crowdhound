# CrowdHound

## About

Some people just want to chill with a dog for an afternoon or a few days, without the responsibility of having them 24/7/365. On the other side of the coin, many busy dog owners have to bug their friends and family, or pay expensive boarding fees when they leave town or canâ€™t come home right after work. CrowdHound lets dog owners and enthusiasts find each other. You can see photos of the dogs and users, read each other's profiles, and filter by preferences (like dog age, weight and distance to you). When you find a profile you like, you can send them a message to connect.
